# INTRODUCTION

This work is based on the paper published by _Phillip Isola, Jun-Yan Zhu, Tinghui Zhou and Alexei A. Efros_ [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004/) and pretends to be a friendly UI to test its capabilities.

Also the model code has been highly based in the article created by _Jason Brownlee_ in its [webpage](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-pix2pix-gan-for-image-to-image-translation/).

Also this project aims to be presented as a _final degree project_ for my _Computer Engineering degree_.
